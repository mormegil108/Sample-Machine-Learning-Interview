# Sample-Machine-Learning-Interview
This repository contains three sample Jupyter notebooks that simulate typical **machine learning interview tasks**.

## Contents
1. **Spam Detection**  
   - Text classification with TF–IDF, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.

2. **Article Clustering**  
   - Unsupervised clustering of documents with TF–IDF, dimensionality reduction, and K-Means. 

3. **Regularized Regression**  
   - Regression with Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet using cross-validation. 


## Important Note on Datasets
The original versions of these notebooks were created for a **technical assessment**.  
Due to **privacy and confidentiality concerns**, I have **not uploaded the raw datasets**.
